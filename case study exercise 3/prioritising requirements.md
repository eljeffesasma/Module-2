## Exercise 3: Prioritizing Requirements

MoSCoW prioritization, also known as the MoSCoW method or MoSCoW analysis, is a popular prioritization technique for managing requirements. The acronym MoSCoW represents four categories of initiatives: must-have, should-have, could-have, and won't-have, or will not have right now.
 MoSCoW is an acronym.

M = Must. 'Must' level requirements are those requirements which will definitely be included to be delivered. 

S = Should. 'Should' level requirements are those requirements which should be included if at all possible. ...

C = Could. 'Could' level requirements are those requirements which could be included in a project

W = Won't. 'Won't' level requirements are those requirements which are discover to be irrelevant or no longer needed in a project.

1. Using MoSCoW, assessment of the functional requirements and Non-functional requirements based on prioritization for the first step project;

- From the functional requirements, *the system should generate (but not send) invoices automatically as orders are received* is a 'Must' level requirement need on the project.

From the functional requirements, *weekly reports of unpaid invoices will be needed by the MD* is a 'Should' level requirement which should be included on the basis of accountability.

From the functional requirements, *it all needs to interface with the payroll system* is a 'Should' level requirement which should be included if at all possible.

From the Non-functional requirements, *all customers need to be added to the system easily* is a 'Must' level requirement which should be included aiding usability

From the Non-functional requirements, *the system must record customers order (not payment yet) up to about 50 per day. This needs to be retained for five years* is a 'Must' level requirement which must be included in the project.

From the Non-functional requirements, *office staff (only) should be able to revise the details of an order and a new invoice should be generated as a result* is a 'Should' level requirement which should be included in the project.

From the Non-functional requirements, *office staff must be able to print invoices or email them to customers* is a 'Could' level requirement which could be included in the project.

From the Non-functional requirements, *the producer manager would like to view all customer orders so that she can plan production* is a 'Could' level requirement which could be included for proper management of resources for production for the project.

From the Non-functional requirements, *it should be possible to vary the payment terms on the invoice* is a 'Won't' level requirement which is not not necessarily needed for the project.

2. Requirement number 7 identified by the MD has a "solution language" where it states that *office staff (only) must be able to revise the details of an order and a new invoice should be generated as a result*. A business analyst must engage the stakeholders (MD and the management team) on the suitability revising the details of an order to verify or check potential errors and also being able to generate a new invoice as a result. It is a 'Should' level requirement which ensures reliability of quality customer service.
