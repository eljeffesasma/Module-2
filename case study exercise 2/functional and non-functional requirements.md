## Exercise 2: Functional and Non-functional Requirements
### 1. A summary of the business objectives of the first step project would be;

a) First of all, to study the systems and operations and identify the scope of the problem.

 b) Engaging the key stakeholders and conducting brainstorming sessions to get exact requirements.

c) Analyzing the problem from different angles and performing gap analysis

d) Documenting exact business needs along with both functional and Non-functional requirements 

e) Preparing business requirements documents (BRD), system requirements specifications (SRS)

f) Creating prototypes, wireframes, mockups and screens based on system needs

g) Interacting with the technology team and helping them to understand the technical aspects of the solution.

h) Overseeing the development, conducting meetings (workshops) while performing project management

i) Conducting usability and functional testing and recommending corrective and preventive actions 

## 2. Identifying functional and Non-functional requirements
### Functional requirements;

i) Weekly reports of unpaid invoices will be needed by the MD

ii) The system should generate (but not send) invoices automatically as orders are received 

iii) It all needs to interface with the payroll system (MD requirement)

### Non-functional requirements;

I) All customers need to be added to the system easily ----- ( categorized under Usability)

II) The system must record customers orders (not payments yet) up to about 50 per day. This needs to be retained for five years. -------- ( categorized under Usability)


III) Office staff (only) should be able to revise the details of an order and a new invoice should be generated as a result --------- ( categorized under Reliability)

IV) Office staff must be able to print invoices or email them to customers ( categorized under Performance i.e speed of reaction)

V) The production officer would like to be able to view all customer orders so that she can plan production (categorized under Performance)

VI) It should be possible to vary the payment terms on the invoice (categorized under flexibility)

- Requirements number 4 & 7 identified by the MD are conflicting each other on the idea of not sending the invoice automatically and the idea of sending the invoice as a mail to customers, after it has been generated.
