## Exercise 1: Stakeholders and Elicitation Techniques 
### 1. Managing Director (Owner)
### 2. Production Manager
### 3. Logistics Manager
### 4. Office Supervisor
### 5. Customers

There are quite a number of techniques for eliciting and exploring requirements for a projects but for this particular project, the suitable techniques on this First Step Project are: 

### Document analysis

### Observation 

### Interview

### Prototyping

### Brainstorming

### Workshop

### Document analysis:

Document analysis is one of the most helpful elicitation techniques in understanding the current process. Documents like user manuals, software vendor manuals, process documents about the current system can provide the inputs for the new system requirements.

Steps involved in document analysis are:

i. Evaluating whether the existing system and business documents are appropriate to be studied.

ii. Analysing the documents to identify relevant business details.
iii. Reviewing and confirming identified details with subject matter experts. 

As a business analyst, the choice of stakeholders highlighted considering this elicitation technique are the Production Manager, Office Supervisor and Logistics Manager; A business analyst needs to understand the current process of the system to be analysed by evaluating the existing documents then to review and confirm the relevant business details with the subject matter experts

### Observation
This elicitation technique helps in collecting requirements by observing users or stakeholders. This can provide information about the exiting process, inputs and outputs. There are two kinds of observations â€” active and passive.
In active observation, the business analyst directly observes the users or stakeholders, whereas in passive observation the business analyst observes the subject matter experts.
This helps the business team understand the requirements when users are unable to explain requirements clearly.

As a business analyst, the stakeholders highlighted considering this elicitation technique are the Managing Director and Customers; An active observation with the Managing Director will be required to aid better understanding and knowledge between a business analyst and the Managing Director knowing he is out of his depth, on clarity and satisfaction while a passive observation will be required for customers observing the subject matter experts to ensure their satisfaction.

### Interview

An interview is a systematic approach to elicit information from a person or group of people. In this case, the business analyst acts as an interviewer. An interview provides an opportunity to explore and/or clarify requirements in more detail. Without knowing the expectations and goals of the stakeholders it is difficult to fulfil requirements.

As a business analyst, the stakeholders highlighted considering this elicitation technique are the Managing Director and the management team i.e the Production Manager, Office Supervisor, Logistics Manager. Interpersonal skills and communication while engaging them will give an opportunity to explore relevant angles and getting clarity based on what they want and how they want it.

### Prototyping

Screen mockups can support the requirement gathering process, when introduced at the correct time. Mockups help stakeholders visualize the functionality of a system. This can be an advantage to business analysts and stakeholders since this allows them to identify gaps/problems early on.

As a business analyst, the stakeholders highlighted considering this elicitation technique are the Managing Director and the management team i.e the Production Manager, Office Supervisor, Logistics Manager. Knowing when to introduce this technique is vital. Post acquisition of relevant details can bring in screen mockups in visualizing the functionality of a system allowing the relevant stakeholders to identify areas yet to be considered but useful and to foresee errors that could occur later on. 

### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is an efficient way to define their requirements. Users can come up with very innovative ideas or requirements. This can help gather ideas and creative solutions from stakeholders in a short time.
Users or stakeholders can come up with ideas that they have seen or experienced elsewhere. These ideas can be reviewed and the relevant ones can then be included in the system requirements.

Introducing this requirement technique, the customers are highlighted as the users of a product or end result of a project. Their diversified opinions on new inventions for satisfaction purposes will aid easier and quicker approach for the project team in terms of customers expectation. 

### Workshop

Workshops comprise a group of users or stakeholders working together to identify requirements. A requirement workshop is a structured way to capture requirements. Workshops are used to scope, discover, define, and prioritize requirements for the proposed system.
They are the most effective way to deliver high-quality requirements quickly. They promote mutual understanding and strong communication between users or stakeholders and the project team.

This technique highlights the Managing Director and the management team i.e the Production Manager, Office Supervisor, Logistics Manager, Project team and Customers. It serves as an avenue to draw out a proposal and perceptions on requirements respectively for the suitability of the project.
